<p>Chase Squires is the first to admit that he's no fitness expert. But he is a guy who used to weigh 205 pounds, more than was healthy for his 5'4" frame. 
"In my vacation pictures in 2002, I looked like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man at the beach," says the 42-year-old Colorado resident. Squires decided enough was 
enough, cut out fatty food, and started walking on a treadmill. The pounds came off and soon he was running marathons -- not fast, but in the race. He ran his first 
50-mile race in October 2003 and completed his first 100-miler a year later. Since then, he's completed several 100-mile, 50-mile, and 50k races.

His secret? "I'm not fast, but I'm consistent," says Squires, who says consistency is his best tip for maintaining a successful fitness regimen.

<h3 class="content_heading">1.Drinking Water</h3>
<p class="details">Health Benefits of Drinking Water
Water has one of the most important roles to play in maintaining a healthy body and some of its benefits include:

Improves Energy Levels & Immunity
The human body maintains a pH range of 7.35-7.45 for proper physiological processes. An acidic shift may lead to sickness and an inability of the body to assimilate 
vitamins and minerals. Thus, it should be above the value of 7, which is favorable to the body’s oxygen uptake, higher energy levels, and a better immune response to 
diseases. This is attainable by consuming lots of water.

<h3 class="content_heading">2.Eating Fruits</h3>

Eating a diet rich in some vegetables and fruits as part of an overall healthy diet may protect against certain types of cancers.
Diets rich in foods containing fiber, such as some vegetables and fruits, may reduce the risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes.
Eating vegetables and fruits rich in potassium as part of an overall healthy diet may lower blood pressure, and may also reduce the risk of developing

<h3 class="content_heading">3.Exercising</h3>
<p class="details">Exercise and physical activity are a great way to feel better, boost your health and have fun. Aim for at least 150 minutes per week of 
moderate-intensity exercise, or 75 minutes per week of vigorous exercise.Try to engage in a combination of vigorous and moderate aerobic exercises, such as running, 
walking or swimming. Squeeze in strength training at least twice per week by lifting free weights, using weight machines or doing body weight exercises.
Space out your activities throughout the week. If you want to lose weight or meet specific fitness goals, you may need to ramp up your exercise efforts.
Remember to check with your doctor before starting a new exercise program, especially if you haven't exercised for a long time, have chronic health problems, such as 
heart disease, diabetes or arthritis, or you have any concerns.
